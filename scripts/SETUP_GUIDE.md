# GitHub Project Setup Guide

This guide explains how to use the files in this repository to create GitHub milestones and issues for the Enterprise Java Development 3.06 project.

## Overview

The repository contains comprehensive documentation and setup scripts to create:

- **4 Milestones** spanning 4 weeks of development
- **23 Issues** organized across 5 phases
- **Complete project board** configuration
- **Automated setup scripts** for easy implementation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub CLI** - Install from https://cli.github.com/
2. **Repository Access** - Clone or fork this repository
3. **Authentication** - Run `gh auth login` to authenticate

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd Enterprise-Java-Development-3.06

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Create milestones
./scripts/setup-milestones.sh

# Create issues
./scripts/setup-issues.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the [Manual Setup](#manual-setup) section below.

### Option 3: Use Structured Data

Use the JSON files in `/scripts/` to integrate with your own tooling:
- `milestones.json` - Complete milestone definitions
- `issues.json` - Complete issue definitions with metadata

| `scripts/setup-issues.sh` | Automated issue creation script | Bash script |
| `scripts/milestones.json` | Milestone data in JSON format | Structured data |
| `scripts/issues.json` | Issue data in JSON format | Structured data |

## Automated Setup Details

### Milestones Created

The `setup-milestones.sh` script creates 4 milestones:

1. **Milestone 1: Working Baseline** (Week 1)
   - Fix compilation errors and get project building
   - Issues: #1-5 (Critical priority)

2. **Milestone 2: Core Task Management** (Week 2)
   - Complete task management system with repositories and services
   - Issues: #6-10 (High priority)

3. **Milestone 3: Contact Management System** (Week 3)
   - Implement PR company system with embedded entities
   - Issues: #11-15 (Medium priority)

4. **Milestone 4: Documentation Complete** (Week 4)
   - Complete documentation and SQL vs JPQL analysis
   - Issues: #16-23 (Medium-Low priority)

### Issues Created

The `setup-issues.sh` script creates the first 7 critical issues:

- **Issues #1-5**: Phase 1 compilation fixes (P0-P1 priority)
- **Issues #6-7**: Phase 2 core features (P1 priority)

**Note**: For demonstration, the script creates the most critical issues. Use the templates in `GITHUB_ISSUE_TEMPLATES.md` to create the remaining issues (#8-23).

## Manual Setup

### Step 1: Create Milestones

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Go to Issues â†’ Milestones
3. Click "New milestone"
4. Use the milestone data from `scripts/milestones.json` or `PROJECT_BOARD_SETUP.md`

### Step 2: Create Issues

1. Go to Issues â†’ New issue
2. Use the templates from `GITHUB_ISSUE_TEMPLATES.md`
3. Copy issue content from `ISSUES.md`
4. Add appropriate labels and assign to milestones

### Step 3: Set Up Project Board

1. Go to Projects â†’ New project
2. Follow the configuration in `PROJECT_BOARD_SETUP.md`
3. Create columns: Backlog, Ready to Start, In Progress, Review, Testing, Done
4. Add automation rules as specified

### Step 4: Assign Issues to Milestones

1. Edit each issue
2. Assign to the appropriate milestone
3. Add labels for priority (P0, P1, P2, P3) and type

## Project Board Configuration

### Recommended Columns

1. **ðŸ“‹ Backlog** - New issues waiting to be prioritized
2. **ðŸš€ Ready to Start** - Issues ready for development
3. **ðŸš§ In Progress** - Currently being worked on
4. **ðŸ‘€ Review** - Code review in progress
5. **ðŸ§ª Testing** - Ready for testing and verification
6. **âœ… Done** - Completed and verified

### Labels System

#### Priority Labels
- `P0` - Critical (blocking)
- `P1` - High (important features)
- `P2` - Medium (additional features)
- `P3` - Low (polish and optimization)

#### Type Labels
- `bug` - Something that's broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `enhancement` - Improvement to existing feature
- `documentation` - Documentation changes
- `testing` - Test-related work

#### Component Labels
- `compilation-error` - Build/compilation issues
- `jpa-annotations` - JPA/Hibernate annotations
- `repository` - Data access layer
- `service-layer` - Business logic layer
- `embedded-entity` - Embedded entities

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Critical Priority** - Must be completed first

1. Start with Issue #1 (Jakarta/javax imports)
2. Fix Issue #2 (@Column annotations)
3. Add Issue #3 (inheritance strategy)
4. Complete Issue #4 (validation annotations)
5. Verify Issue #5 (project builds successfully)

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)
**High Priority** - Core functionality

1. Create repositories (Issue #6)
2. Implement service layer (Issue #7)
3. Add comprehensive testing (Issues #8-9)
4. Document inheritance strategy (Issue #10)

### Phase 3: Extended Features (Week 3)
**Medium Priority** - Additional functionality

1. Implement embedded entities (Issues #11-12)
2. Create contact management (Issues #13-14)
3. Test embedded functionality (Issue #15)

### Phase 4-5: Documentation and Polish (Week 4)
**Medium-Low Priority** - Documentation and optimization

1. SQL vs JPQL analysis (Issues #16-17)
2. Comprehensive documentation (Issues #18-19)
3. Final polish and optimization (Issues #20-23)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **GitHub CLI not authenticated**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Permission denied on scripts**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

3. **Milestone creation fails**
   - Verify repository access
   - Check if milestones already exist
   - Ensure proper authentication

4. **Issue creation fails**
   - Verify issue templates format
   - Check label existence
   - Ensure milestone exists before assignment

### Script Customization

To modify the scripts for your specific needs:

1. **Edit milestone dates**: Modify date calculations in `setup-milestones.sh`
2. **Customize issue content**: Edit issue bodies in `setup-issues.sh`
3. **Add additional issues**: Follow the pattern in `setup-issues.sh`
4. **Modify labels**: Update label assignments as needed

## Integration with External Tools

### Using JSON Data

The structured data files can be imported into various tools:

```javascript
// Example: Reading milestone data
const milestones = require('./scripts/milestones.json');
milestones.milestones.forEach(milestone => {
  console.log(`${milestone.title}: ${milestone.description}`);
});
```

### API Integration

Use the GitHub API directly with the structured data:

```bash
# Create milestone via API
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/milestones \
  -d '{"title":"Milestone 1: Working Baseline","description":"...","due_on":"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z"}'
```

## Next Steps

After setting up milestones and issues:

1. **Assign team members** to appropriate issues
2. **Set up notifications** for issue updates
3. **Configure branch protection** rules
4. **Start with Phase 1** critical issues
5. **Review progress** weekly against milestones
